# 6stringbeliever.github.io
My code portfolio github site. Started building it with knockout.js because I wanted to use structured data for my project
lists, but then decided that was silly. So then I converted it to plain HTML. But I still wanted structured data, so
I'm re-doing it again using Jekyll and my original structured data. This should give me a little more flexibility to
expand this in the future.
